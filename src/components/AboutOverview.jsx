            <p>
              I help engineers feel confident with clear onboarding, intuitive tools, and team
              rhythms that work.
            </p>
            <p>
              My background spans program management, engineering leadership, curriculum design, and
              full-stack development. In every role, I focus on how people experience the systems we
              build.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m at my best simplifying, humanizing, and scaling the systems that support people.
            </p>
